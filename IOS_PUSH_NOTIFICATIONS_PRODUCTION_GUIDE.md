## üöÄ Testing on iOS Device (Real Device Required)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** iOS Simulator **does NOT support push notifications**. You MUST use a real device.

### **Step 1: Build and Run on Device**

1. **Open Xcode:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/hady/Documents/Work/ClixSys/Projects/MobileApps/PRE/pre
   open ios/App/App.xcworkspace
   ```

2. **Select Your Device:**
   - In Xcode toolbar, click the device dropdown
   - Select your connected iPhone/iPad
   - Make sure it's not "Any iOS Device (arm64)"

3. **Sign the App:**
   - Click on `App` target in left sidebar
   - Go to `Signing & Capabilities` tab
   - Make sure your Apple Developer Team is selected
   - Ensure "Automatically manage signing" is checked

4. **Verify Push Notifications Capability:**
   - In `Signing & Capabilities` tab
   - You should see `Push Notifications` capability
   - If not, click `+ Capability` and add `Push Notifications`

5. **Build and Run:**
   - Press `Cmd + R` or click the Play button
   - Wait for build to complete
   - App will install and launch on your device

---

### **Step 2: Watch for Permission Request**

Once the app launches and you sign in, watch the **Xcode Console** for these logs:

```
FCM Boot: Auth state changed - user authenticated
FCM Boot: Initializing FCM (source: onAuthStateChanged)...
FCMService: Starting initialization...
FCMService: Initializing native push notifications...
FCMService: Requesting native push permission...
```

**A system alert should appear:**
> "PRE Group" Would Like to Send You Notifications
> 
> This app would like to send you notifications about important updates, announcements, and personalized content from your community.
> 
> [Don't Allow] [Allow]

**Tap "Allow"**

---

### **Step 3: Verify Token Registration**

After allowing, look for these logs:

```
FCMService: Native push permission granted
FCMService: Registering for native push...
FCMService: Native push registration successful: <device_token>
FCMService: Got native FCM token: fXXXXXXXXXX...
FCMService: Saving token to Firestore...
FCMService: Token saved successfully
```

**Verify in Firestore:**
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Navigate to `Firestore Database`
3. Go to `users/{your-uid}/tokens`
4. You should see a new document with:
   - `token: "fXXXXXXXXXX..."`
   - `platform: "ios"`
   - `createdAt: <timestamp>`

---

### **Step 4: Send a Test Notification**

1. **Open Admin Dashboard:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/#/notifications
   ```

2. **Create Notification:**
   - Title EN: `iOS Test`
   - Title AR: `ÿßÿÆÿ™ÿ®ÿßÿ± iOS`
   - Body EN: `This is coming to your iPhone!`
   - Body AR: `Ÿáÿ∞ÿß ŸÇÿßÿØŸÖ ÿ•ŸÑŸâ ÿ¨Ÿáÿßÿ≤ iPhone ÿßŸÑÿÆÿßÿµ ÿ®ŸÉ!`
   - Type: `Announcement`
   - Send immediately: ‚úÖ
   - Audience: `All Users`

3. **Click "Create & Send Now"**

---

### **Step 5: Observe Notification Behavior**

#### **A. App in Foreground:**
- iOS will NOT show system notification by default
- Your app should show an in-app banner/dialog (Quasar Notify)
- Check console for: `FCMService: Notification received (foreground)`

#### **B. App in Background:**
- iOS will show a notification banner at the top
- Swipe down from top to see notification center
- You should see: "PRE Group - iOS Test"

#### **C. App Closed/Killed:**
- iOS will show a notification banner
- Notification will appear in Notification Center
- Tapping it will launch your app

#### **D. Lock Screen:**
- Notification appears on lock screen
- Shows your app icon, title, and body
- Badge count increases

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **Problem: No Permission Alert Appears**

**Check 1: Auth State**
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check Xcode console for `Auth state changed - user authenticated`

**Check 2: Already Denied?**
- Go to iOS Settings > PRE Group > Notifications
- If "Allow Notifications" is OFF, turn it ON
- Restart the app

**Check 3: Timing Issue**
- If no alert after 3-4 seconds, close and reopen the app
- The boot file has a 2-second delay for iOS

---

### **Problem: Permission Granted but No Token**

**Check Xcode Console:**
```
FCMService: Native push registration successful: <device_token>
```

If you see this but no FCM token:
- **Check Firebase Project Settings:**
  - Firebase Console > Project Settings > Cloud Messaging
  - Make sure iOS APNs certificate/key is uploaded
  - Use `.p8` auth key (recommended) or `.p12` certificate

**Verify APNs Key:**
1. Go to [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list)
2. Create a new APNs Key (if needed)
3. Download the `.p8` file
4. Go to Firebase Console > Project Settings > Cloud Messaging
5. Under "iOS app configuration", upload the `.p8` file
6. Enter your Key ID and Team ID

---

### **Problem: Token Saves but Notifications Not Received**

**Check Cloud Function Logs:**
```bash
firebase functions:log --only sendNotificationOnCreate
```

Look for:
- ‚úÖ `[sendNotificationOnCreate] Processing notification:`
- ‚úÖ `Successfully sent to token: fXXXX...`
- ‚ùå `Error sending to token: InvalidToken`

**If "InvalidToken" error:**
- The device token is invalid (common during development)
- App will automatically refresh token next time
- Try deleting token from Firestore and reopening app

**Check Notification Document:**
```
status: "sent"
tokensCount: 1
successCount: 1
failureCount: 0
```

If `failureCount: 1`, there was a problem with your device token.

---

### **Problem: App Crashes on Launch**

**Check Xcode Console for:**
```
[Firebase/Messaging][I-FCM...] Error
```

**Common causes:**
1. Missing `GoogleService-Info.plist`
2. Wrong bundle ID in Firebase Console
3. APNs certificate not configured

**Verify:**
```bash
cd /Users/hady/Documents/Work/ClixSys/Projects/MobileApps/PRE/pre
ls -la ios/App/App/GoogleService-Info.plist
```

Should exist. If not, download from Firebase Console.

## üéØ Current Implementation Flow

### **On App Launch (User Already Logged In):**

1. `fcm.js` boot file runs
2. Waits for `onAuthStateChanged` to fire (iOS uses persistence)
3. After 2-second delay (iOS-specific)
4. Calls `fcmService.initialize()`
5. Requests native push permission (iOS alert)
6. User taps "Allow"
7. Gets APNs device token
8. Exchanges for FCM token
9. Saves to Firestore: `users/{uid}/tokens/{tokenId}`
10. Sets up notification listeners

### **On Admin Sends Notification:**

1. Admin creates notification document with `sendNow: true`
2. Cloud Function `sendNotificationOnCreate` triggers
3. Collects all tokens for target audience
4. Sends via `admin.messaging().sendMulticast()`
5. Updates notification document with success/failure counts
6. Removes any invalid tokens

### **On User Receives Notification:**

#### **Foreground:**
- `fcmService.setupForegroundHandler()` catches it
- Displays Quasar Notify banner
- User can tap to navigate

#### **Background/Closed:**
- iOS system displays notification
- User taps notification
- `setupNotificationActionPerformed()` catches tap
- Navigates to specified route (from `click_action` data)

## üîê Security Notes

### **Token Management:**
- Tokens are user-specific (stored under `users/{uid}/tokens`)
- Invalid tokens are automatically removed by Cloud Function
- Tokens are refreshed if they expire

### **Firestore Rules:**
```javascript
// Only authenticated users can read/write their own tokens
match /users/{userId}/tokens/{tokenId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}

// Only admins can write notifications
match /notifications/{notificationId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow write: if request.auth != null && 
                  request.auth.token.role == 'admin';
}
```

### **Cloud Function Security:**
- Function runs with Admin SDK privileges
- Only triggered on notification document creation (not user-writable)
- Validates audience and filters tokens appropriately

---

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### **Track Key Metrics:**

1. **Permission Grant Rate:**
   - % of users who allow notifications
   - Optimize permission request timing

2. **Delivery Success Rate:**
   - `successCount / tokensCount`
   - Should be >95% for healthy system

3. **Notification Engagement:**
   - How many users tap notifications
   - Which notification types get most engagement

4. **Token Churn:**
   - How often tokens become invalid
   - May indicate users uninstalling/reinstalling

### **Firebase Console Monitoring:**

1. **Cloud Functions Logs:**
   ```
   Firebase Console > Functions > sendNotificationOnCreate > Logs
   ```

2. **Firestore Usage:**
   ```
   Firebase Console > Firestore > Usage
   ```
   - Monitor read/write counts
   - Optimize if token queries become expensive

3. **FCM Metrics:**
   ```
   Firebase Console > Cloud Messaging
   ```
   - Total messages sent
   - Delivery rate
   - Error codes

## üöÄ Next Steps

### **Immediate:**
1. ‚úÖ Test permission request on real device
2. ‚úÖ Verify token saves to Firestore
3. ‚úÖ Send test notification and confirm receipt

### **Before Production:**
1. Add in-app notification preferences screen
