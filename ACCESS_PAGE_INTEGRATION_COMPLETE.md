## 🚀 How to Use

### For End Users:

#### **BLE Control Tab:**

1. Navigate to `/access` in the app
2. The BLE Control tab opens by default
3. Tap "Connect to Gate" to scan for BLE devices
4. Select your gate device from the browser/system dialog
5. Once connected, tap "Open Gate" to unlock
6. Tap "Disconnect" when done

#### **Gate Passes Tab:**

1. Switch to the "Gate Passes" tab
2. Tap "Generate Pass" button
3. Enter guest name, purpose, and validity date
4. Tap "Generate" to create the pass
5. QR code is automatically generated
6. Tap "Share" to send via native sharing (mobile) or download (web)
7. Tap "Delete" to remove a pass

### For Developers:

#### **BLE Configuration:**

The BLE UUIDs are configured in `src/pages/auth/Access.vue` (lines 254-256):

```javascript
const SERVICE_UUID = '12345678-1234-5678-1234-56789abcdef0'
const CHARACTERISTIC_UUID = 'abcdefab-cdef-1234-5678-abcdefabcdef'
const GATE_PASSWORD = 'OPEN123'
```

**⚠️ Change these to match your ESP32 device!**

#### **QR Code Format:**

Each QR code contains JSON data:

```javascript
{
  code: 'GATE-XXXXX',      // Unique code
  guestName: 'John Doe',    // Guest name
  validUntil: '2025-01-15T12:00:00.000Z' // ISO date
}
```

## 📱 Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies (if not already done)

```bash
# BLE Plugin
npm install @capacitor-community/bluetooth-le

# Sync Capacitor
npx cap sync
```

### 2. Configure Android Permissions

Add to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
```

### 3. Configure iOS Permissions

Add to `ios/App/App/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs Bluetooth to connect to your gate device</string>
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs Bluetooth to connect to your gate device</string>
```

### 4. Update BLE UUIDs

Edit `src/pages/auth/Access.vue` (around line 254) to match your ESP32:

```javascript
const SERVICE_UUID = 'YOUR-ESP32-SERVICE-UUID'
const CHARACTERISTIC_UUID = 'YOUR-ESP32-CHARACTERISTIC-UUID'
const GATE_PASSWORD = 'YOUR-GATE-PASSWORD'
```

### 5. Test

```bash
# Web (Chrome/Edge required for BLE)
npm run dev
# Navigate to: http://localhost:9000/access

# Android
npx cap run android

# iOS
npx cap run ios
```

- **Color-coded status indicators**:
  - 🔵 Blue: Disconnected/Scanning
  - 🟢 Green: Connected
  - 🟠 Orange: Connecting
  - 🔴 Red: Error/Failed
- **Responsive grid** for pass cards
- **Material Design icons** from Quasar

### Animations

- ✨ Pulse animation during BLE connection

## 🔐 Security Features

### Current Implementation:

- ✅ Route requires authentication
- ✅ Passes stored in localStorage (local to device)
- ✅ Unique pass codes generated
- ⚠️ BLE password hardcoded (for development)

### Production Recommendations:

1. **Pass Storage**: Move to Firestore for cloud sync
2. **BLE Password**: Store per user in Firestore
3. **Pass Validation**: Add backend verification
4. **Access Logging**: Log all gate access attempts
5. **Expiration**: Auto-expire passes based on `validUntil`
6. **Permissions**: Check user permissions before allowing gate control

## 📊 Technical Details

### Dependencies Used:

- `qrcode` (already in package.json) - QR code generation
- `@capacitor-community/bluetooth-le` - BLE on iOS/Android
- `@capacitor/share` - Native sharing on mobile
- `quasar` - UI components

### State Management:

- **Reactive Vue refs** for all UI state
- **LocalStorage** for pass persistence
- **Map** for QR canvas refs (efficient rendering)
- **Composable pattern** for BLE logic reuse

### Performance:

- ⚡ QR codes generated on-demand
- ⚡ Lazy canvas rendering
- ⚡ Minimal re-renders with Vue's reactivity
- ⚡ localStorage caching for passes

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Bluetooth Not Supported"

**Solution:**

- On web: Use Chrome or Edge (not Firefox/Safari)
- On mobile: Ensure Bluetooth is enabled
- Check permissions are granted

### Issue: Cannot Connect to Gate

**Solution:**

- Verify ESP32 is powered on and advertising
- Check UUIDs match exactly
- Ensure device is in range (<30m)
- Check ESP32 Serial Monitor for errors

### Issue: QR Code Not Showing

**Solution:**

- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure QRCode library is installed: `npm install qrcode`
- Verify canvas element is rendered (check with devtools)

### Issue: Share Not Working

**Solution:**

- On iOS/Android: Check if Capacitor Share plugin is installed
- On web: Check browser permissions for downloads
- Verify canvas.toBlob() is supported
