## 🔧 For BLE Gate Control

### Prerequisites:

1. **Install BLE Plugin**:

   ```bash
   npm install @capacitor-community/bluetooth-le
   ```

2. **Update UUIDs** in `src/pages/auth/Access.vue` (line ~260):

   ```javascript
   const SERVICE_UUID = 'YOUR-ESP32-SERVICE-UUID'
   const CHARACTERISTIC_UUID = 'YOUR-ESP32-CHAR-UUID'
   const GATE_PASSWORD = 'YOUR-PASSWORD'
   ```

3. **Add Android Permissions** to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
   ```

4. **Add iOS Permissions** to `ios/App/App/Info.plist`:
   ```xml
   <key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app needs Bluetooth to connect to your gate device</string>
   ```

### Test BLE on Mobile:

```bash
# Build first
npm run build

# Android
npx cap run android

# iOS
npx cap run ios
```

## 🐛 Still Getting Errors?

### Option 1: Check Console (F12)

Look for error messages in the browser console and share them with me.

### Option 2: Test Passes First

The **Gate Passes** tab should work immediately without any BLE setup!

### Option 3: Common Fixes

**Error: "Cannot find module"**

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Error: "QRCode not found"**

```bash
# Already installed in package.json, but verify:
npm list qrcode
# Should show: qrcode@1.5.4
```

**Error: "BLE not supported"**

- **Expected on Firefox/Safari** - Switch to Chrome/Edge
- **On mobile**: Enable Bluetooth in device settings
