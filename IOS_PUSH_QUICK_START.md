### **Step 1: Open in Xcode**
```bash
cd /Users/hady/Documents/Work/ClixSys/Projects/MobileApps/PRE/pre
open ios/App/App.xcworkspace
```

### **Step 2: Connect Your iPhone**
- Plug in via USB
- Select it in Xcode toolbar (top-left)
- Make sure "Automatically manage signing" is checked
- Your Apple Developer Team should be selected

### **Step 3: Build & Run**
- Press `Cmd + R` (or click Play button)
- App will install and launch on your device

### **Step 4: Sign In**
- Use your test account credentials
- Wait 2-3 seconds after login

### **Step 5: Allow Notifications**
When you see this system alert:

> "PRE Group" Would Like to Send You Notifications
> 
> This app would like to send you notifications about important updates...
> 
> [Don't Allow] [Allow]

**Tap "Allow"** ✅

### **Step 6: Send Test Notification**

1. Open dashboard: `http://localhost:3000/#/notifications`
2. Create notification:
   - Title EN: `iOS Test`
   - Body EN: `Coming to your iPhone!`
   - Send immediately: ✅
   - Audience: All Users
3. Click "Create & Send Now"

### **Step 7: Verify**

**In Xcode Console:**
```
✅ FCM Boot: FCM initialized successfully
✅ FCMService: Token saved successfully
✅ [sendNotificationOnCreate] Successfully sent to token: fXXX...
```

**On Your iPhone:**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **No Permission Alert?**
- Check if already denied: Settings > PRE Group > Notifications > Turn ON
- Make sure you're logged in
- Close and reopen app

### **Permission Granted but No Token?**
- Verify APNs key uploaded to Firebase Console:
  - Project Settings > Cloud Messaging > iOS app configuration
  - Upload `.p8` key from Apple Developer portal

### **Token Saved but No Notification?**
- Check Firebase Functions logs:
  ```bash
  firebase functions:log --only sendNotificationOnCreate
  ```
- Verify notification status in Firestore:
  - Should show `status: "sent"`, `successCount: 1`
