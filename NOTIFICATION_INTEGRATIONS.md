#### Service Requests

- ✅ **Resolved:** "Your complaint has been resolved!"
- ❌ **Closed:** "Your complaint case has been closed."

#### Requests

## 🔧 Implementation Notes

### Error Handling
All notification sends are wrapped in try-catch blocks:
- ✅ Main action (booking, complaint, etc.) always succeeds
- ⚠️ If notification fails, it's logged but doesn't break the flow
- 📝 Users still get their confirmation, just no notification

### Performance
- **Async:** Notifications sent asynchronously
- **Non-blocking:** Main action completes first
- **Fast:** Notifications appear within milliseconds
- **Real-time:** Firestore listeners update UI immediately

### Reliability
- **Firestore Security:** Rules ensure users only see their own notifications
- **Indexed:** Composite index on (userId, projectId, createdAt) for fast queries
- **Cached:** Real-time listeners mean no unnecessary re-fetches

## 📝 Code Example: Adding Notifications to New Services

// 1. Import the notification service
import { createNotification, NOTIFICATION_TYPES } from './notificationCenterService'

// 2. After your main action succeeds, send a notification
try {
  await createNotification({
    userId: user.uid,
    projectId: projectId,
    title: 'Action Completed',
    message: 'Your action has been completed successfully.',
    type: NOTIFICATION_TYPES.SUCCESS,
    actionUrl: '/relevant-page'
  });
  console.log('✅ Notification sent');
} catch (notifError) {
  console.error('⚠️ Failed to send notification:', notifError);
  // Don't fail the main action if notification fails
}
```
