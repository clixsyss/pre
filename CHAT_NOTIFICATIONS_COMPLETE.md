---

## 📱 Chat Systems Integrated

### 1. Complaint Chats (`complaintService.js`)

**When:** Admin replies to user's complaint  
**Notification:**
- **Title:** "New Reply on Your Complaint"
- **Message:** "Admin has replied to your complaint: '[Complaint Title]'"
- **Type:** Complaint (red icon 💬)
- **Action:** Navigate to `/complaints/[ID]`

**Example:**
```
User submits: "Noise complaint about neighbor"
Admin replies: "We'll investigate this issue"
→ User receives notification
```

---

### 2. Service Booking Chats (`serviceBookingService.js`)

**When:** Admin replies to user's service request  
**Notification:**
- **Title:** "New Reply on Your Service Request"
- **Message:** "Admin has replied to your [Service Name] request."
- **Type:** Service (blue icon 🛠️)
- **Action:** Navigate to `/service-booking-chat/[ID]`

**Example:**
```
User requests: Pool cleaning service
Admin replies: "Scheduled for tomorrow at 10 AM"
→ User receives notification
```

---

### 3. Request Submission Chats (`requestSubmissionService.js`)

**When:** Admin replies to user's facility request  
**Notification:**
- **Title:** "New Reply on Your Request"
- **Message:** "Admin has replied to your [Category] request."
- **Type:** Request (yellow icon 📝)
- **Action:** Navigate to `/request-chat/[ID]`

**Example:**
```
User submits: Moving furniture request
Admin replies: "Please provide additional details"
→ User receives notification
```

---

### 4. Support Chats (`supportService.js`)

**When:** Admin/support team replies to user's ticket  
**Notification:**
- **Title:** "New Reply from Support Team"
- **Message:** "Support team has responded to your ticket."

---

### 5. Violation Chats (`finesService.js`)

**When:** Admin replies to user's violation appeal  
**Notification:**
- **Title:** "New Reply on Your Violation"
- **Message:** "Admin has replied to your violation case: [Violation Title]"
- **Type:** Violation (red icon ⚠️)
- **Action:** Navigate to `/violation-chat/[ID]`

**Example:**
```
User disputes: Parking violation fine
Admin replies: "We've reviewed your case"
→ User receives notification
```

---

## 🔄 Complete User Flow

### Initial Submission
1. User submits complaint/request/booking
2. ✅ **Notification:** "Your [item] has been submitted"
3. User sees in notification center

### Admin Reply
4. Admin opens chat and replies
5. ✅ **Notification:** "Admin has replied to your [item]"
6. Badge appears on bell icon
7. User clicks notification
8. Opens chat to see reply

### Ongoing Conversation
9. User replies back (no notification to user)
10. Admin replies again
11. ✅ **Notification:** Another notification sent
12. Continues until resolved

---

## 🎯 Smart Notification Logic

### Only Send When:
✅ Sender is an admin (`senderType === 'admin'`)  
✅ Receiver is the original user (not admin replying to themselves)  
✅ Message is successfully saved to database  

### Don't Send When:
❌ User sends their own message  
❌ Admin replies to themselves (edge case prevention)  
❌ Database save fails (wrapped in try-catch)  

---

## 💡 Technical Implementation

### Code Pattern (Consistent Across All Services)

```javascript
// After message is saved to database
try {
  if (messageData.senderType === 'admin' && originalUserId !== adminId) {
    await createNotification({
      userId: originalUserId,
      projectId: projectId,
      title: 'New Reply on Your [Item]',
      message: 'Admin has replied...',
      type: NOTIFICATION_TYPES.APPROPRIATE_TYPE,
      actionUrl: `/path/to/chat/${id}`
    });
    console.log('✅ Notification sent');
  }
} catch (notifError) {
  console.error('⚠️ Failed to send notification:', notifError);
  // Main message still succeeds
}
```

### Safety Features:
- **Non-blocking:** Notification failures don't break chat functionality
- **Error logging:** All notification errors are logged for debugging
- **Type checking:** Validates sender type before sending
- **User validation:** Ensures user exists before sending
