# 🔴 Fix: iOS Token Not Being Received

## Current Problem

Your logs show:
```
✅ Permission granted: "receive": "granted"
✅ Registered for push notifications
❌ NO TOKEN RECEIVED!
```

The `registration` event is **not firing** on iOS.

---

## 🎯 **MOST LIKELY CAUSE: Missing APNs Key in Firebase**

### **Quick Test: Check Firebase Console**

1. **Go to**: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. **Select**: `pre-group` project
3. **Go to**: ⚙️ Project Settings → **Cloud Messaging** tab
4. **Scroll to**: "Apple app configuration"

### **What You Should See:**
```
✅ APNs Authentication Key
   Key ID: XXXXXXXXXX
   Team ID: XXXXXXXXXX
```

### **If You See This Instead:**
```
❌ No APNs Authentication Key uploaded
   Upload an APNs Authentication Key to enable push notifications
```

**→ YOU NEED TO UPLOAD THE KEY! (See below)**

---

## 🔑 Solution 1: Upload APNs Authentication Key (RECOMMENDED)

### **Step 1: Create APNs Auth Key**

1. **Go to**: https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list
2. **Sign in** with your Apple Developer account
3. **Click**: ➕ **"Create a key"**
4. **Name**: `Firebase PRE Push Notifications`
5. **Enable**: ☑️ **Apple Push Notifications service (APNs)**
6. **Click**: **Continue** → **Register**
7. **Download** the `.p8` file (e.g., `AuthKey_AB12CD34EF.p8`)
   - ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: You can only download this ONCE! Save it safely!
8. **Note down**:
   - **Key ID**: (e.g., `AB12CD34EF`)
   - **Team ID**: Found at top of page (e.g., `XYZ123ABC4`)

### **Step 2: Upload to Firebase Console**

1. **Back to Firebase Console**: Project Settings → Cloud Messaging
2. Under **"Apple app configuration"**, find your iOS app:
   ```
   Bundle ID: com.pregroup.app
   ```
3. **Click**: **"Upload"** under APNs Authentication Key
4. **Upload** the `.p8` file you downloaded
5. **Enter**:
   - **Key ID**: (from Step 1)
   - **Team ID**: (from Step 1)
6. **Click**: **Upload**

### **Step 3: Wait & Rebuild**

1. **Wait**: 2-3 minutes for Firebase to process
2. **Clean build** in Xcode:
   ```
   Product → Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
   ```
3. **Rebuild** and run on your device
4. **Check logs** again

---

## 📱 Solution 2: Verify Xcode Configuration

### **Open Xcode Project:**
```bash
open /Users/hady/Documents/Work/ClixSys/Projects/MobileApps/PRE/pre/ios/App/App.xcworkspace
```

### **Check 1: Push Notifications Capability**

1. Select **App** target (blue icon at top)
2. Go to **"Signing & Capabilities"** tab
3. **Look for**: "Push Notifications"

**If it's missing:**
1. Click **"+ Capability"**
2. Search and add **"Push Notifications"**

### **Check 2: Background Modes**

Still in "Signing & Capabilities":
1. **Look for**: "Background Modes"
2. **Verify** these are checked:
   - ☑️ **Remote notifications**

**If Background Modes is missing:**
1. Click **"+ Capability"**
2. Add **"Background Modes"**
3. Enable **"Remote notifications"**

### **Check 3: Signing**

1. Under **"Signing & Capabilities"**
2. **Verify**:
   - **Team**: Your Apple Developer team is selected
   - **Bundle Identifier**: `com.pregroup.app` (matches Firebase)
   - **Signing Certificate**: Valid iOS Development certificate

### **Check 4: GoogleService-Info.plist**

1. In Xcode **Project Navigator** (left sidebar)
2. Look for `GoogleService-Info.plist`
3. **If it's RED**: File is missing!
   - Delete it
   - Re-add from disk: Right-click App folder → Add Files
   - Navigate to: `/Users/hady/Documents/Work/ClixSys/Projects/MobileApps/PRE/pre/ios/App/App/GoogleService-Info.plist`
   - **Check**: "Copy items if needed"
   - **Check**: "Add to targets: App"

## 🧪 Testing After Fixes

### **Step 1: Clean Rebuild**
```bash
cd /Users/hady/Documents/Work/ClixSys/Projects/MobileApps/PRE/pre
npx quasar clean
npx cap sync ios
```

### **Step 2: Rebuild in Xcode**
1. Open Xcode workspace
2. **Product** → **Clean Build Folder** (Cmd+Shift+K)
3. **Product** → **Build** (Cmd+B)
4. **Run** on your physical device

### **Step 3: Check Enhanced Logs**

I've added more detailed logging. You should now see:

**On successful token registration:**
```
🎉 FCMService: Native registration success!
🎉 FCMService: Token: <long token string>
🎉 FCMService: Saving token to Firestore for user: OpljNxl2HvVV6a6VIvXI4CgYq9Z2
✅ FCMService: Token saved successfully!
```

**If registration fails:**
```
❌ FCMService: Registration error: <error details>
❌ FCMService: Error details: <JSON error>
```

**If still no event:**
```
(Nothing - means registration event never fired)
→ APNs key issue OR provisioning profile issue
```

## 🔍 Issue 2: Verify Specific User Targeting

### **Check Firestore Notification Document**

1. **Go to**: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. **Firestore Database** → **Data** tab
3. **Navigate to**:
   ```
   projects → {your-project-id} → notifications → {notification-id}
   ```

### **Check These Fields:**

```javascript
{
  "audience": {
    "all": false,          // ← Should be false for specific users
    "uids": [              // ← Should contain specific user IDs
      "OpljNxl2HvVV6a6VIvXI4CgYq9Z2",
      "anotherUserId123"
    ],
    "topic": null
  },
  "status": "sent",        // ← Should be "sent"
  "tokensCount": 2,        // ← Number of tokens sent to
  "successCount": 1,       // ← Number of successful sends
  "failureCount": 1        // ← Number of failed sends
}
```

### **Check User's Tokens Collection**

1. **Navigate to**:
   ```
   users → OpljNxl2HvVV6a6VIvXI4CgYq9Z2 → tokens
   ```

2. **You should see**:
   ```
   tokens/
   ├─ {token-id-web}/
   │  ├─ token: "long-fcm-web-token..."
   │  ├─ platform: "web"
   │  └─ createdAt: <timestamp>
   │
   └─ {token-id-ios}/   ← THIS SHOULD EXIST!
      ├─ token: "long-apns-token..."
      ├─ platform: "ios"
      └─ createdAt: <timestamp>
   ```

**If iOS token is MISSING:**
- This confirms the registration event is not firing
- You MUST fix the APNs key issue

**If iOS token EXISTS but no notification received:**
- The Cloud Function DID send to the token
- But the device didn't receive it
- Check:
  1. Device has internet connection
  2. App is not in "Do Not Disturb" mode
  3. APNs key is correct in Firebase
  4. App is properly signed with correct provisioning profile

---

## 🚨 Common Mistakes

### **1. Using iOS Simulator**
❌ **iOS Simulator does NOT support push notifications**
✅ **MUST use real physical device**

### **2. Wrong Bundle ID**
Your Firebase project expects: `com.pregroup.app`
If Xcode shows different Bundle ID → notifications won't work

### **3. Development vs Production**
- APNs has **two environments**: Development & Production
- **Development**: For apps signed with Development provisioning profile
- **Production**: For apps signed with Distribution provisioning profile (App Store, TestFlight, Ad-Hoc)

**If you're testing with Xcode (development build):**
- APNs key works for BOTH (recommended)
- OR use Development certificate

### **4. Expired Certificates**
Check in Apple Developer Portal if certificates are expired

### **5. Missing Entitlements**
The `App.entitlements` file must have:
```xml
<key>aps-environment</key>
<string>development</string>  <!-- or "production" -->
```

## 📊 Decision Tree

```
Can't receive notifications on iOS?
│
├─ Token not saved to Firestore?
│  │
│  ├─ No 🎉 icon logs? → APNs key missing in Firebase
│  │                      → Upload APNs Auth Key (Solution 1)
│  │
│  └─ ❌ Registration error? → Check error details
│                             → Fix provisioning profile
│                             → Fix entitlements
│
└─ Token exists in Firestore?
   │
   ├─ Cloud Function says "sent"? → Device-side issue
   │                               → Check internet
   │                               → Check Do Not Disturb
   │                               → Reinstall app
   │
   └─ Cloud Function failed? → Check function logs
                              → Check token validity
```

## 📞 Still Not Working?

If after all these steps you still don't get a token:

### **Debug Checklist:**
- [ ] APNs Auth Key uploaded to Firebase? (with correct Key ID and Team ID)
- [ ] "Push Notifications" capability added in Xcode?
- [ ] "Background Modes - Remote notifications" enabled?
- [ ] Signing team selected and valid certificate?
- [ ] Bundle ID matches Firebase project?
- [ ] GoogleService-Info.plist in project and not red?
- [ ] Testing on **real device** (not simulator)?
- [ ] Device has internet connection?
- [ ] App has notification permissions (not denied)?
- [ ] Clean rebuild after all changes?

### **Collect Debug Info:**
1. Screenshot of Firebase Console → Cloud Messaging → Apple app config
2. Screenshot of Xcode → Signing & Capabilities tab
3. Complete Xcode console logs
4. Firestore screenshot of: `users/{uid}/tokens` collection

**Send these to debug further!**
