## 🚀 Testing Steps

### **Step 1: Open Xcode**
```bash
cd /Users/hady/Documents/Work/ClixSys/Projects/MobileApps/PRE/pre
open ios/App/App.xcworkspace
```
- [ ] Xcode opened successfully

### **Step 2: Configure Signing**

```

- [ ] Console logs correct

### **Step 6: Verify Token in Firestore**
1. Go to Firebase Console > Firestore
2. Navigate to: `users/{your-uid}/tokens`
3. Should see a document with:
   - `token: "fXXXX..."`
   - `platform: "ios"`
   - `createdAt: <timestamp>`

- [ ] Token document exists

   - **Body AR:** هذا قادم إلى iPhone الخاص بك!
   - **Type:** Announcement
   - **Send immediately:** ✅
   - **Audience:** All Users
3. Click "Create & Send Now"

- [ ] Notification created

- [ ] `sentAt: <timestamp>`
- [ ] `successCount: 1` (or more)
- [ ] `failureCount: 0`

### **Step 8: Test Notification Delivery**

#### **Test A: Foreground (App Open)**
- [ ] App is open and in foreground
- [ ] Send notification from dashboard

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Checklist

### **If No Permission Alert:**
- [ ] Check auth state: User logged in?
- [ ] Check timing: Wait 2-3 seconds after login
- [ ] Check iOS Settings > PRE Group > Notifications (not already denied?)
- [ ] Close and reopen app

### **If Permission Granted but No Token:**
- [ ] APNs key uploaded to Firebase? (Check Firebase Console)
- [ ] Key ID and Team ID correct?
- [ ] Device has internet connection?
- [ ] Check Xcode console for FCM errors

### **If Token Saved but No Notification:**
- [ ] Check Cloud Function logs: `firebase functions:log`
- [ ] Check notification status in Firestore: `status: "sent"`?
- [ ] Check `failureCount` - if > 0, token may be invalid
- [ ] Device has internet connection?
- [ ] Try sending another notification

### **If App Crashes:**
- [ ] Check Xcode console for error details
- [ ] Verify `GoogleService-Info.plist` exists in iOS project
- [ ] Verify bundle ID matches Firebase project
- [ ] Clean build folder: Product > Clean Build Folder
- [ ] Delete app from device and reinstall
