# User Migration - Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 What Was Implemented?

A complete user migration system that allows old users (stored only in Firestore with an `oldId`) to migrate to Firebase Authentication by setting a password.

## 📦 What's Included?

✅ Migration detection on sign-in  
✅ Beautiful migration page with password setup  
✅ Secure Cloud Function for server-side migration  
✅ Complete error handling and validation  
✅ Cross-platform support (iOS, Android, Web)  
✅ Comprehensive logging and monitoring  

## 🚀 Quick Deploy (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd /Users/hady/Documents/Work/ClixSys/Projects/MobileApps/PRE/pre/functions
npm install
```

### Step 2: Deploy Functions
```bash
cd ..
./deploy-functions.sh
```
Or manually:
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Step 3: Test It!
1. Create a test user in Firestore:
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - oldId: `OLD_123`
   - migrated: `false`

2. Try signing in with that email
3. You'll be redirected to set a password
4. Complete migration and sign in!

## 📱 User Experience

### Before Migration
```
User tries to sign in
    ↓
"Please set a new password to complete your account migration"
    ↓
Redirects to migration page
```

│                             │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### After Migration
```
"Account migrated successfully!"
    ↓
Redirects to sign in
    ↓
User can now sign in with email + password
```

## 🔍 How to Identify Migration Users?

Users who need migration have:
- ✅ Document in Firestore `users` collection
- ✅ `oldId` field present
- ✅ `migrated` field is `false` or missing
- ❌ No record in Firebase Authentication

## 🧪 Quick Test

```bash
# 1. Create test user in Firestore (Firebase Console)
{
  "email": "olduser@test.com",
  "oldId": "OLD_TEST_001",
  "migrated": false,
  "firstName": "Test",
  "lastName": "User"
}

# 2. Try signing in with the app
# 3. Should redirect to migration page
# 4. Set password and complete migration
# 5. Sign in successfully with new password
```

## 📊 Monitoring

### View Function Logs
```bash
firebase functions:log
```

### View Real-Time Logs
```bash
firebase functions:log --only migrateOldUser
```

### Check Function Status
```bash
firebase functions:list
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Function not found"
**Solution:** Deploy functions first
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Problem: Migration fails
**Solution:** Check logs
```bash
firebase functions:log
```

### Problem: "Permission denied"
**Solution:** Check Firestore rules allow user reads
