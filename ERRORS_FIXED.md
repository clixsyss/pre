## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with Gate Passes tab** - Works immediately, no hardware needed
2. **Test QR codes** - Generate, share, delete all work
3. **BLE needs ESP32** - Or will just show device picker and cancel
4. **Use Chrome/Edge** for web BLE testing (not Firefox/Safari)
5. **Check console** - Detailed logging helps debug any issues

**All fixed! Test it now!** 🚀
