# Cache Invalidation Fix - Bookings Now Appear Immediately

## Problem
After creating a booking, it wouldn't appear in "My Bookings" until closing and reopening the app. This was because:
1. Cached data was being returned instead of fresh data
2. The fetch happened too quickly before Firestore committed the write
3. Some booking types didn't trigger a refresh

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive cache invalidation system:

### What Was Fixed

1. **Automatic Cache Invalidation in `firestoreService.addDoc()`**
   - Every time a document is created, the cache for that collection is automatically invalidated
   - Works for both native (iOS/Android) and web platforms

2. **Manual Cache Invalidation in `bookingService.createCourtBooking()`**
   - Explicitly invalidates the bookings cache after creating a court booking
   - Belt-and-suspenders approach for reliability

3. **Timing Improvements**
   - Added 500ms delay after creating booking before fetching
   - This ensures Firestore has fully committed the write
   - Applied to all booking types: court, service, and academy

4. **Consistent Refresh Pattern**
   - All booking creation flows now:
     1. Create the booking
     2. Show success notification
     3. Wait 500ms
     4. Invalidate cache
     5. Fetch fresh data
     6. Navigate to bookings page

## Files Changed

### Core Services
- ✅ `src/services/firestoreService.js` - Auto cache invalidation
- ✅ `src/services/bookingService.js` - Manual cache invalidation

### Booking Pages
- ✅ `src/pages/auth/CourtBooking.vue` - Court bookings
- ✅ `src/pages/auth/ServiceCategoryDetails.vue` - Service bookings
- ✅ `src/pages/auth/AcademyRegistration.vue` - Academy registrations

### Supporting Services
- ✅ `src/services/cacheService.js` - Already had `invalidatePattern()` method

## Testing Checklist

### Court Bookings
- [ ] Create a court booking
- [ ] Verify success notification appears
- [ ] Wait 2-3 seconds
- [ ] Verify you're redirected to My Bookings
- [ ] **Verify the new booking appears immediately**

### Service Bookings
- [ ] Book a service
- [ ] Verify success notification appears
- [ ] Check My Bookings tab
- [ ] **Verify the new service booking appears immediately**

### Academy Programs
- [ ] Register for an academy program
- [ ] Verify success notification appears
- [ ] Wait for redirect
- [ ] **Verify the registration appears in My Bookings immediately**

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
```
1. Create booking ✅
2. Show success ✅
3. Fetch bookings (gets cached data) ❌
4. Navigate to My Bookings
5. Booking not shown ❌
6. Close and reopen app
7. Booking now appears ✅
```

### After Fix
```
1. Create booking ✅
2. Invalidate cache ✅
3. Show success ✅
4. Wait 500ms ✅
5. Fetch fresh bookings ✅
6. Navigate to My Bookings
7. Booking appears immediately! ✅✅✅
```

## Console Logs to Look For

When creating a booking, you should see:
```
🗑️ Invalidating bookings cache...
🗄️ Cache invalidated: 2 items matching "collection:projects/.../bookings"
⏰ End time: 2025-10-01T08:15:47.692Z
✅ Court booking created successfully: { bookingId: "..." }
```

Then when fetching:
```
🗄️ Cache miss: collection:projects/.../bookings:...
🚀 FirestoreService: Getting collection docs for: projects/.../bookings
✅ AcademyStore: User bookings fetched: 1
```

The cache miss is GOOD - it means we're fetching fresh data!

## Technical Implementation

```javascript
// In firestoreService.addDoc()
const result = await capacitorFirestore.addDocument({
  reference: collectionPath,
  data: serializedData
});

// Automatically invalidate cache
cacheService.invalidatePattern(`collection:${collectionPath}`);

return { id: result.id };
```

```javascript
// In booking creation flow
const result = await bookingService.createCourtBooking(projectId, bookingData);

if (result.success) {
  // Show success
  notificationStore.showSuccess('Booking created!');
  
  // Wait for Firestore to commit
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
  
  // Fetch fresh data (cache already invalidated)
  await academiesStore.fetchUserBookings(user.uid, projectId);
  
  // Navigate
  router.push('/my-bookings');
}
```

## Why This Works

1. **Cache Invalidation**: Removes stale data from memory
2. **500ms Delay**: Ensures Firestore has committed the write (eventual consistency)
3. **Fresh Fetch**: Queries Firestore directly since cache was invalidated
4. **Reactive Updates**: Vue's reactivity system updates the UI immediately

## Rebuild Instructions

After pulling these changes:

```bash
# Clean and rebuild
npm run build
npx cap sync ios

# Open Xcode and run
npx cap open ios
```

Or use the script:
```bash
./rebuild-ios.sh
```

## Notes

- The 500ms delay is conservative - Firestore is usually faster
- Cache invalidation happens automatically for ALL `addDoc` calls
- This fix applies to ALL booking types across the app
- No breaking changes - backward compatible
